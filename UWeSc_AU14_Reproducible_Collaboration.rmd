## Motivation {.big}

- To **do** reproducible research & encourage others to do so also

- Increase **credibility**: article as only advertisement; show the correctness of my results 

- Increase **impact**: allow reuse of method; currently the main beneficiary is future me

## Challenges

<div class="columns-2">
![](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3662/3674715600_57a4e914e4.jpg)

* Pre-publication work viewed as trade secrets 

* Anxiety about exposure to ridicule 

* Wide variation in data analysis tools

* Scripted analyses are uncommon 
</div>

## Culture shock

* Oberg (1960) popularized the term culture shock as the "anxiety that results from losing all of our familiar signs and symbols of social
intercourse"

* Weaver (1994) says culture shock has three basic
causal explanations:
1. the loss of familiar cues,
2. the breakdown of interpersonal communications, and
3. an identity crisis

* Phenomenological etiology: A researcher cannot convey and validate central aspects of their identity

## Technical challenges {.big}

* Dependencies 

* Imprecise documentation

* Code rot

* Barriers to adoption and reuse in existing solutions

## Solutions 

* For the cultural problems
1. Do all of the work
2. Validate
3. Isolate
4. Educate

* For the technical problems
1. Workflow software
2. Virtual machines
3. Linux Containers

## Do all the work  {.big}

* Repository with code and data (R markdown file, scripts, [RProj](https://github.com/benmarwick/Pleistocene-aged-stone-artefacts-from-Jerimalai--East-Timor/blob/master/Marwick-et-al-Jeremalai-lithics-2014.Rproj), R package)

* Review cycle means MS Word is a necessary format

* Code is circulated with co-authors, but they don't do anything with it 

* Cited and described in methods section

## Validation {.big}

* Decipher analysis in Excel or SPSS file

* Recompute all or some with R

* Create repository with R code and data

* More like a lab notebook, not cited in manuscript

    - [Osseous Artefacts](https://github.com/benmarwick/Aplin-et-al-Osseous-artefacts-island-SEA)

## Isolation {.big}

* Keep my contribution self-contained

* Create repository for my contribution (from specific commit or release)

* Cite repository in publication at figure caption (with no explanation)

    - [Putslaagte](https://github.com/benmarwick/Particle-size-analysis-Putslaagte-1) [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618214003036)
    - [Madjebebe](https://github.com/benmarwick/Rocks-and-burials-at-Madjebebe) [paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arco.5039/abstract)
    - [Sulawesi](http://github.com/benmarwick/Stratigraphy-and-radiocarbon-dates-from-Gua-Mo-o-hono-Sulawesi)
    
## Education {.big}

* Require student collaborators to acquire skills (sneak into coursework, require it for graduate student milestones, Software Carpentry)

* Normalise scripted analyses by talking about it, showing it, citing it (at appropriate moments...)

* Advocate Open Methods, flattery often works (open science may be a bridge too far for some)

## Technical problems {.big}

* Workflow software: elegant but esoteric & nobody uses them

* [Virtual machine](http://collaboratool.berkeley.edu/): isolated & intelligible but heavyweight & black box

* Linux container: in their infancy...

## Docker

* Operating system-level virtualization: very lightweight Linux VM 

* Plain text [Dockerfile](https://github.com/rocker-org/hadleyverse/blob/master/Dockerfile)   
    - defines and documents the image
    - includes all software dependencies down to the level of the OS
    - is easily stored, shared and versioned
    - minimizing dependency and code rot problems

* My use is inspired by the [rocker project](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/) of Carl Boettiger & Dirk Eddelbuettel, and [Carl's paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0846)

## Docker and barriers to adoption

* Is optimized at the level of single applications, for me this is RStudio and the shell

* Less disruptive to established workflows; not a drain on my laptop, I can use my usual text editor, use RStudio in my web browser, etc.

* Highly portable to give identical environments across different machines; images can be snapshotted

* Reusing and remixing images is trivial

* [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rocker/hadleyverse/) gives free open hosting and continuous integration for images (can link to dockerfiles hosted on github, etc.)

## Limitations of Docker {.big}

* Docker does not provide complete visualization but relies on the Linux kernel provided by the host

* Docker is limited to 64 bit host machines

* On Windows & OSX Docker must still be run in a fully virtualized environment (VirtualBox). The [boot2docker](http://boot2docker.io/) tool helps, but could be smoother 

* Potential security issues

* Will Docker be significantly adopted by any scientific research or teaching community?

## Future directions {.big}

* Increase visibility of scripted analyses to reduce culture shock

* Create opportunities with minimal [inessential weirdness](http://www.classmatters.org/2006_07/its-not-them.php) for students to learn & peers to familiarize (Software Carpentry, Open Methods)

* Research project as R package (rather than RProj, scripts, etc.)

* Document dependencies with Dockerfile and use Docker as a common computational environment for research and teaching
